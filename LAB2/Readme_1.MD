In this we implemented merge sort algorithm using IPC.


Firstly Extract all the files.

Then, we have to generate numbers.

./Generate_Numbers
This will make "Input.txt" file in which 100 numbers randomly generated within range(0, 1000)

Now to sort this file and to run our program.
Compile the mergesort.c program using the command =>
gcc mergesort.c -o mergesort

Now to run over mergesort program =>
./mergesort Input.txt

This will form "Output.txt" in which all the given numbers are in sorted format.

ASSUMPTION -> In Input.txt first number is how many numbers are there.
